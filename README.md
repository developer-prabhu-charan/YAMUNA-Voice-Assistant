# 🗣️ Yamuna – AI Voice Assistant

**Yamuna** is a smart and customizable **Python-based voice assistant** built to simplify your daily tasks through voice commands. Designed as a lightweight personal AI, Yamuna can perform actions like opening apps, answering questions, and interacting with APIs — all using natural language.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎙️ **Voice Recognition:** Converts your voice into commands using `SpeechRecognition`.
- 💬 **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Responds naturally via `pyttsx3` or `gTTS`.
- 🧠 **Context Awareness:** Understands common phrases, keywords, and command patterns.
- 🖥️ **System Automation:** Open applications, websites, files, or control basic OS functions.
- 🌐 **Online Capabilities:** Fetch weather, tell time, search Google or Wikipedia.
- 📅 **Productivity Assistant:** Set alarms, create reminders, take notes.
- 🛠️ **Modular and Hackable:** Easily extend or integrate with IoT, LLMs, or APIs.
